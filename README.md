# Secret-Diary
If you would like to read the main HTML and PHP file then please look at index.php.

A project which uses HTML,CSS,jQuery, PHP and MySQL. This project also uses forms with Bootstrap styling.
A user can choose to either sign up or login to their account. Once the user logs in, they are taken to a page with diary, where the user
can type whatever they desire. The diary uses an AJAX request to save the text automatically as the user is typing in thier message. The 
user can then logout and return to their diary as they left it, after logging in. This project also incorporates COOKIE and SESSION variables
so the user can choose to stay logged in if they wish even if they close the browser.

This project was difficult but also rewarding as I learnt alot about using PHP and MySQL together to create a powerful back end system.
